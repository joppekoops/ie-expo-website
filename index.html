						<p>We believe that every person has an artist inside them, whether it is often practised or not.<br>Colours of Note is a project developed to inspire creativity among people with dementia. People can play instruments that fill the blank canvas with bright colours, where the note of each instrument is translated into a vibrant array of colours. This results in an interesting work of art through co-creation that everyone can participate in. Hence, taking a refreshing approach to art therapy where one has the opportunity to become a visual artist through a music performance.<br>Additionally, the title, “Colours of Note” carries multiple meanings. It refers to the colours that a musical note presents, along with another meaning that emphasises the importance of this project and the impact it has on those with dementia by calling it of note. We hope to encourage people to create memories with others by sharing a note and that this project serves as a reason to add colours to each other’s lives and create memories through experience - even if they may not last forever.</p>

						<p>"Visitor Voices" by Commonplace is a pioneering project reshaping the gallery experience. By making use of the innovative beam speaker, an audio technology that precisely directs sound waves to a desired area, the focused audio delivery enhances the immersive encounter with art, allowing viewers to engage intimately with the pieces before them.<br>Still in its prototype phase, "Visitor Voices" envisions a future where museum-goers contribute to an open dialogue. The groundwork for a website, which empowers visitors to record and share personal reflections via their mobile devices, has already been laid. This platform becomes a virtual space with narratives, shared experiences and perspectives.<br>The project was crafted by Merel Thuis, Marek Bartek, Jurre de Krom and Karlo Stefanek, under the guidance and leadership of Jon Steam and Simon de Bakker.</p>
